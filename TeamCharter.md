> [!IMPORTANT]
> Text that has been put into a callout are suggested additions. Text that has been struckthrough are suggested removals. This callout won't be in the final charter and just exists for collaboration purposes.


> ### Project Management
> Milestones and User Stories will be managed on the [Github Project](https://github.com/users/shorian/projects/1/views/1). The same goes for various tasks which will be managed by the issue tracker and viewable both from the issues and project board.
> 
> #### Git Procedure
> 
> - Create a feature branch to make changes
> - Push your feature branch to the shared repo (shorian/GreatOutdoors)
> - Open a pull request to propose merging with main
>   - Be careful to select shorian/GreatOutdoors:main as the base branch - it defaults to Poul's upstream repo.
>   - In case of merge conflicts, try to resolve the merge on your local branch, then push again.
> 
> The commands you would use to do the above (with the exception of step 3 which occurs within Github itself) should be similar to the following:
> 1. `git checkout -b [feature-branch-name]` (creates a feature branch and switches to it at the same time)
> 2. `git add .` (adds all changes that you've made; be sure you did your changes before using this command)
> 3. `git commit -m "[short summary of your changes]"`
> 4. `git push origin [feature-branch-name]`
> 
> Please read error messaged given to you within the git bash. Oftentimes the simplest solution is detailed by the error messages themselves, and even if it isn't, the error messages will at least give you some direction as to what went wrong.
> 
> **Do not use destructive Git commands such as `git reset`, `git prune`, `git clean` before consulting other team members.** Git is an amazing time machine and these commands can disable us from solving whatever problem you may be facing.

> [!NOTE]
> This removal is due to migrating this portion down to the section regarding Team Agreements. A corresponding addition callout is down there.

### Communication

#### Meeting Schedule

Frequency: Weekly
Day/Time: Every Friday at 5pm
Location/Platform: Discord voice/video

> To prepare for meetings, please try to have assigned tasks done the day before. If you hit a snag, come prepared to discuss it and work through it with the team.

- Discord is out preferred medium for communications outside meetings.
  - SMS is our fallback if anyone is having trouble with Discord.
- Milestones and User Stories will be managed by the [github project](https://github.com/users/shorian/projects/1/views/1)
- Aim to respond to messages within 24 hours, Mon-Fri
  - Quentin is generally unavailable 5pm-noon and on Wednesdays
  - Sid tries not to do substantial schoolwork on weekends
- If any of us suspects we may miss a deadline, we will inform the team immediately in order to plan around it
  - Do not wait until you are already late!
- We strive to make decisions by team consensus
  - If we find ourselves unable to reach agreement in a reasonable timeframe, we will first discuss the issue with Poul, as he may be able to offer insight or technical reasons to prefer one option over another
  - If we continue to disagree, we will decide the issue by majority vote. (tiebreaker?)

~~**Team Procedure**~~
~~1. We plan to revise these agreements when we have a clearer sense of the work we'll be doing together.~~
  ~~- Every meeting we will have a chance to revise this agreement.~~
~~2. Accountability~~
  ~~- We will inform the group immediately when we suspect that we might miss a deadline we agreed to.~~
    ~~- We will not wait until we are already late!~~
~~3. The moment we suspect that we might not make a deadline we will inform the group so that we may plan around it.~~
  ~~- We will be meeting on Fridays, so we’ll make our best effort to complete assigned tasks by Thursday, and come prepared to discuss it and work through it together if we hit a snag.~~
~~4. Conflict Resolution~~
  ~~- If we find ourselves unable to come to agreement on some issue, we will decide by majority vote.~~
~~5. We will discuss conflicts with Poul before voting, he may be able to offer insight or technical reasons to prefer one choice over another.~~
~~6. Git procedure~~
~~7. Don’t use destructive commands like git clean and git prune before discussing them with the team. Commands that can destroy history usually provide warnings.~~
